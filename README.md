E-MAT

=====


The E-MAT, or the Electronic Motion Assistance Tool, is a suite of tools created to assist clinicians. The Tremor Tool uses a single IMU to detect the frequency and magnitude of a tremor based on acceleration and gyroscope data. The next tools to be implemented are the Motion Capture Tools which use multiple IMUs to track gross motor skills.
