E-MAT

=====


The E-MAT, or the Electronic Motion Assistance Tool, is a suite of tools created to assist clinicians. The most work has been done with the tremor tool, which uses a single IMU to detect the frequency and magnitude of a tremor. Our goals include using multiple IMUs to track gross motor skills.




**Features Planned:**

  *Tremor Tool

  *Frequencies
  *Mangnitudes

  *Linear and rotational

* Motion Capture Tool

  * Using multiple IMUs

  * Ball-chase activity

  * Real time feedback for the users



**Hardware:**
