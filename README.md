E-MAT

=====


The E-MAT, or the Electronic Motion Assistance Tool, is a suite of tools created to assist clinicians. The Tremor Tool uses a single IMU to detect the frequency and magnitude of a tremor based on acceleration and gyroscope data. Then next tool to be implemented is the Motion Capture Tool which uses multiple IMUs to track gross motor skills.

**Features Completed:**
* Tremor Tool
  * Frequencies
  * Relative Magnitudes
  * Linear and rotational
